title: Philadelphia Startup Leaders Manifesto

<section class="manifesto">
  <h2>Because startup entrepreneurs need each other.</h2>

  <p>Starting a company can be a long and lonely journey.</p>

  <p>Each milestone is a small miracle—from idea to prototype, from first employee to first customer, from first revenues to first profits and eventually to a thriving, successful business.  Most startups fail along the way.</p>

  <p>To survive this journey, startup entrepreneurs need many things. They need access to funding and talent.  They need support from their government and their community.  They need opportunities to educate themselves and their team.</p>

  <p>But more than anything else, startup entrepreneurs need each other.</p>

  <p>No one can truly understand the life of an entrepreneur but another entrepreneur—no matter how much time they might spend investing, teaching, consulting, servicing, or legislating in the world of startups.</p>

  <p>Philly Startup Leaders is a community of startup entrepreneurs dedicated to helping each other on their entrepreneurial journeys.</p>

  <p>We provide the kind of emotional and practical support that can only come from a fellow entrepreneur. Emotionally, we share wisdom, inspiration, and friendship. Practically, we share advice, connections, and resources.  We mentor each other and coach new entrepreneurs who are making the transition.</p>

  <p>We often collaborate and connect with the larger ecosystem—with people and organizations who are not themselves entrepreneurial.</p>

  <p>But what makes us so different and so effective is our focus on connecting entrepreneurs with each other.</p>

  <p>We thrive because we understand that, above all else, startup entrepreneurs need each other.</p>
